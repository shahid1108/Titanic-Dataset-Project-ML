# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning Project

- This project analyzes the Titanic passenger data to predict survival outcomes using machine learning models.It showcases the end-to-end data science workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

#  📊 Project Overview
- The Titanic dataset is one of the most iconic beginner datasets for binary classification. In this project, we:

- Explore and clean the data

- Engineer relevant features

- Apply machine learning models to predict survival

- Evaluate and interpret model performance

#  📁 Dataset
- The dataset used is from the Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition and includes:

- train.csv: labeled data with survival outcome

- test.csv: unlabeled data for predictions

**Key Features**:

- PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked

# 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍

- Pandas for data manipulation

- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

- Jupyter Notebook for iterative development
